# 💻 Problem Solving Hub

Welcome to my **Problem Solving Hub** — a growing collection of programming challenges, training sheets, and contest problems.
Here I tackle **logic puzzles, algorithms, and data structures**, all coded in **C++** (and sometimes other languages).

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Centralized repository for **all solved problems**  
- Track progress and revisit solutions anytime  
- Organized and scalable for **future sheets, contests, and platforms**  

---

## 📂 Structure

```
Source/Sheet_or_Contest/ProblemID/solution.cpp
```

- `AssiutSheets/` → Beginner-friendly training sheets  
- `Codeforces/` → Contests and virtual participation  
- `OtherPlatforms/` → Future sources  

Each problem lives in its own folder for clarity and maintainability.

## 💡 Philosophy

> Solving problems isn’t just coding; it’s exercising logic, sharpening algorithms, and learning to think like a computer.  
> Every solution is a step toward mastery.  

---

## 🛠️ Notes

- Folder names reflect **source and problem ID**  
- README stays general; updates happen inside folders  
- This repo is **meant to grow** — the more problems I solve, the bigger it gets
